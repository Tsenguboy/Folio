# Folio
I've included a sample web demo which manipulates data received from the back-end. It is assumed that the data has already been received, thus the dummy data in the local machine. 

Aside from this, I've included other ReactJS snippets that I've worked on before. These are mainly there to measure my skills, the main purpose being to show I'm familiar with javascript, and not to show that I can create a website that works. It's from a much bigger repository, but if you are interested, I can make it so that these all works singularly.
