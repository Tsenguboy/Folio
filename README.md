I've included a sample web demo which manipulates data received from the back-end. It is assumed that the data has already been received, thus the dummy data in the local machine. 

Aside from this, I've included other ReactJS snippets that I've worked on before. I've included them to try to showcase my skills, and show you that I'm familiar with ReactJS, CSS, HTML, and creating functional sites isn't my only skill.

The samples are from a much bigger repository, but if you are interested, I can tamper with them to have them function nicely.
